## Overview

This repository serves as a practical introduction to prompt engineering‚Äîdesigned for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts working with large language models like Google's Gemini models.

You'll learn:

- How prompts influence LLM outputs  
- Core techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting  
- Common prompting patterns and pitfalls  
- Best practices for writing, testing, and improving prompts  

---

## Learning Topics

- Prompting Basics: structure, format, and clarity  
- Zero-shot vs. Few-shot Prompting  
- Chain-of-Thought Reasoning  
- Instruction and Persona Prompts  
- Iterative Prompt Refinement  
- Prompt Evaluation Techniques

## Usage & Examples

Each markdown file contains clear explanations, annotated examples, and prompts ready for use in LLM interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT API, Claude, Gemini).

Example workflows:

- **Prompting Basics** ‚Äì Learn how slight changes in prompt phrasing affect LLM behavior  
- **Techniques** ‚Äì Practice few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompts  
- **Exercises** ‚Äì Apply what you‚Äôve learned through small challenges and analyze outputs  
- **Refinement** ‚Äì Rework prompts iteratively for better results or fewer hallucinations  

To try out prompts, you can:

- Paste them directly into an LLM playground (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)  
- Use your own Python/OpenAI API wrapper to call them programmatically
