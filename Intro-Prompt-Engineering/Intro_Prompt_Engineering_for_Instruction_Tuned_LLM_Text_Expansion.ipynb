        "# Controlling Output Variability with Temperature\n",
        "\n",
        "One important parameter when working with language models is temperature, which controls the randomness or creativity of the model’s responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can think of temperature as adjusting the model’s willingness to explore less likely options. For example, if you start with the phrase:\n",
        "\"My favorite food is\"\n",
        "- At temperature = 0, the model will always choose the most likely next word (e.g., \"pizza\").\n",
        "- At higher temperatures (e.g., 0.7), the model may pick alternatives like \"sushi\" or \"tacos\", even if they’re less likely.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the model continues generating, the differences between responses (e.g., \"pizza\" vs. \"tacos\") become more pronounced. Higher temperatures lead to more diverse and creative outputs, while lower temperatures produce more consistent and predictable results.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to use different temperatures:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Use temperature = 0 when you want reliable, repeatable outputs, such as for production systems or precise tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "🎨 Use higher temperatures (e.g., 0.7 or 1.0) for creative tasks where variety is valuable, like brainstorming or storytelling."
